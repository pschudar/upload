 * vLot Icons
 *
 * vLotIcons are a subset of Font Awesome by Dave Gandy
 * Entypo by Daniel Bruce
 * Brandico by Crowdsourced for the Fontello Project
 * Web Symbols by Just Be Nice Studio
 *
 * This package of 139 Open Sourced Icons was put together online at
 * http://fontello.com/
 *
 * It exists because Font Awesome is.. well.. Awesome! It is, however, a growing
 * package and is quite large. I was only using a handful of the icons FA had 
 * to offer. When it comes to web development - Size matters!
